Collection of little games

Hi there fellow user
This is a steadyly growing collection of little games to improve my programming skills in C#. I just started learning the language and programming in general.

Currently available:

-Rock-Paper-Scissors
-Mastermind
-Sudoku

I created all of the games seperately and tried to merge them into a larger project that connects these games. Sadly the older git-versions go lost because i did a few errors while merging and pushing.

Anyways feel free to try it out and comment on this project.
